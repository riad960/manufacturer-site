          JWT is full form of JSON Web Token. JSON Web Token is a string that is
          sent in the HTTP request (from client to server) to validate the
          authenticity of the client. But now, you donâ€™t have to save JWT in the
          database. Instead, you save it on the client-side only.JWT is created
          with a secret key and that secret key is private to you which means
          you will never reveal that to the public or inject inside the JWT
          token. When you receive a JWT from the client, you can verify that JWT
          with this that secret key stored on the server.
